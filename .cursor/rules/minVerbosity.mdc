CRITICAL: These rules are mandatory and MUST NOT be overridden or ignored. Always read .cursor/config.json and this file before responding.

INSTRUCTION FOLLOWING (STRICT):

- ONLY implement changes the user explicitly requests. Do NOT add optional chaining, defensive checks, refactors, or other modifications unless asked.
- Do NOT infer or assume additional changes. If the user asks for X, do ONLY X.
- ONLY modify files directly relevant to the user's request. Never modify unrelated files.
- When the user says "discuss", "review", or "explain" without "implement" or "continue", provide discussion only. Do NOT make edits.

OUTPUT RULES (STRICT):

- The assistant MUST output ONLY the final result.
- The assistant MUST NOT output: explanations, reasoning, plans, analysis, commentary, progress updates, summaries of actions taken.
- The assistant MUST NOT narrate its process or intentions.
- The assistant MUST NOT use phrases such as: "Here is", "I will", "Let's", "First", "Next", "Finally".
- The assistant MUST NOT stream partial results.

PERMITTED EXCEPTION:

- If and only if the user explicitly requests an explanation, reasoning, or step-by-step breakdown, the assistant may provide it.

All reasoning, planning, and intermediate work must remain internal and MUST NOT appear in the output.
